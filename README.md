- [ ] Take pictures of the object - you'll want between 60-100 images
- [ ] Move the pictures from the camera to your file system 
- [ ] **Annotate** your images using CVAT
- [ ] Download your annotations and create a training and validation set 
- [ ] Train the model using the annotated images 
- [ ] Download the model 
- [ ] Use the model with the python script
